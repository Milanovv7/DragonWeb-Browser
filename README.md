# DragonWeb-Browser


DragonWeb v2 is here.

Here's what's new:

• Errors when switching between tabs bug fixed.

• Errors when opening the app bug fixed.

• Now even smoother performance.


Option 1 (Windows only)

 
To get DragonWeb you need Windows and you must have Chrome installed with the Ignore X-Frame headers extension from the Chrome web store, Visual Studio Code is required as well. Then, right click on your desktop>New>Shortcut and put the link of the code from that website which you can see by opening the index.html file from this code. Then, right click on your Desktop > New > Shortcut. Copy this prompt and paste it in that feild:

"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --app="file:///PATH/TO/DragonWeb.html"

Replace PATH/TO/DragonWeb.html with the location of the index.html file you just downloaded.

If it doesn't work, try opening the code in Visual Studio Code and open it with Live Server. after you have opened it with Live Server inside Google Chrome, go to the 3 dots menu at the top right corner, find Cast, Save and Share and then Download as an app. You're just gonna name it DragonWeb and you're good to go.

Download all the files except the README.md file. Every VS Code file you downloaded put in a folder that you'll create in Visual Studio Code. Name the folder that you just created in Viaual Studio Code "Files" or anything else that you'll recognize the folder as the files of the app. Make sure you save the app files for VS Code you just downloaded.


Option 2 (Much easier way, for Windows, macOS, Linux & ChromeOS)


Make sure that your computer meets its OS requirement:

• macOS Sierra or later

• Windows 7 or later

• Linux (depends on the distro)

• ChromeOS version 72 or later


Open Google Chrome and install the Ignore X-Frame headers extension from the Chrome web store. Then, in your Chrome search bar put in this URL: https://milanovv7.github.io/DragonWeb-Online-Demo/

You'll be taken to the web version of the browser. From here you can test it before actually installing it. If you wanna install it, while you're here click on the 3 dots menu in the top right corner, hover over Cast, save, and share. Click on Download page as app.

Enjoy your browsing.
