# DragonWeb-Browser
To get DragonWeb you need Windows and you must have Chrome installed with the Ignore X-Frame headers extension from the Chrome web store, Visual Studio Code is required as well. Then, right click on your desktop>New>Shortcut and put the link of the code from that website which you can see by opening the index.html file from this code. Then, right click on your Desktop > New > Shortcut. Copy this prompt and paste it in that feild:

"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --app="file:///PATH/TO/DragonWeb.html"

Replace PATH/TO/DragonWeb.html with the location of the index.html file you just downloaded.

If it doesn't work, try opening the code in Visual Studio Code and open it with Live Server. after you have opened it with Live Server inside Google Chrome, go to the 3 doth menu at the top right corner, find Cast, Save and Share and then Download as an app. You're just gonna name it DragonWeb and you're good to go.

Download all the files except the README.md file. Every VS Code file you downloaded put in a folder that you'll create in Visual Studio Code. Name the folder that you judt created in Viaual Studio Code "Files" or anything else that you'll recognize the folder as the files of the app. Make sure you save the app files for VS Code you just downloaded.
