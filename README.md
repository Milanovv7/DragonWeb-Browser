# DragonWeb-Browser
To get DragonWeb you need Windows and you must have Chrome installed with the Ignore X-Frame headers extension from the Chrome web store, Visual Studio Code is not necessary, but we do recommend having it. Then, right click on your desktop>New>Shortcut and put the link of the code from that website which you can see by opening the index.html file from this code. Then, right click on your Desktop > New > Shortcut. Copy this prompt and paste it in that feild:

"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --app="file:///PATH/TO/DragonWeb.html"

Replace PATH/TO/DragonWeb.html with the location of the index.html file you just downloaded.
